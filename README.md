# EserciziPrep
This is my personal practice space where I started learning Python from scratch â€” writing small scripts, learning functions, and building basic tools for working with DNA sequences.

## ðŸ”§ What I practiced so far:
- Writing Python functions for common bioinformatics tasks
- Reading and processing DNA sequences (FASTA files, string ops)
- Creating small utilities like:
    - GC content calculator
    - Reverse complements
    - Codon to protein translation
- Getting comfortable with loops, conditionals, and file handling

This repo represents my hands-on learning process â€” experimenting, testing, and building up confidence in both coding and computational thinking.
